-   Every time a ZSH shell runs, we need to run a 'git fetch' to check if the user needs to 'git pull' our new features/bug fixes etc
-   Issue with the installation of the dependencies(e.g. node_modules). Should I include 'npm/yarn install' in the installation script? Is there a way to copy fast the node_modules(e.g. file links? - if I change a dependency with a hard link all the dependencies will be changed)?
